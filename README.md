# meetingsummary

## Project Overview:
The project aims to develop a Python-based AI script that generates summaries of meeting transcriptions from written text files. The script must utilize a locally installed Large Language Model (LLM), as we require an open-source solution that can be deployed on our Windows 11 PC with an Nvidia GPU and CUDA installed.

## Project Deliverables:

-    An AI script written in Python that can summarize meeting transcriptions.
-    Integration with an open-source LLM suitable for local deployment.
-    Documentation and support for the deployment and operation of the script.
